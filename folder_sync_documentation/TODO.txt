folder_sync TODO

    - Maybe shorten and optimize get_existing_items. Function also needs more testing.
    - Rewrite code to only work with absolute paths to avoid needing to change working directory.
    Only use relative paths in sync files (to work with rsync) and exclude files (for consistency).
    - Rewrite code to use pathlib instead of os
    - Make deletions work over ssh
    - Add safe_mode as default mode where you always first do a dry run and if you accept output then do real sync.
    - Avoid changing working directory at all. Right now this happens in create_file_dict. Change it.
    - create_sync_objects should be rewritten and incorporated in Syncer class
    - RESOLVE ERROR: dir path:  was no in dirs but in files!
    - RESOLVE ERROR: Right now something is wrong with state_dict Doesnt correctly store files?
    At least files cannot be found. Something to do with changes implemented since last
    commit since it worked correctly then (I think)
