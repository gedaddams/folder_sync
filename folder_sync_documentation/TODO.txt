folder_sync TODO

    - Maybe shorten and optimize get_existing_items. Function also needs more testing.
    - Make deletions work over ssh
    - Add safe_mode as default mode where you always first do a dry run and if you accept output then do real sync.
    - Change Excluder, create_file_dict etc to work with file_names instead of relative file paths. Only create file_paths when needed.
    Ex when comparing modification dates and writing to file used by rsync. Sync object should probably contain file_paths since they
    write them to file.
