folder_sync TODO

    - Maybe shorten and optimize get_existing_items. Function also needs more testing.
    - Rewrite code to only work with absolute paths to avoid needing to change working directory.
    Only use relative paths in sync files (to work with rsync) and exclude files (for consistency).
    - Rewrite code to use pathlib instead of os
    - Make deletions work over ssh
    - Add safe_mode as default mode where you always first do a dry run and if you accept output then do real sync.
    - Change Excluder, create_file_dict etc to work with file_names instead of relative file paths. Only create file_paths when needed.
    Ex when comparing modification dates and writing to file used by rsync. Sync object should probably contain file_paths since they
    write them to file.
