folder_sync behavior

- If file/folder on ignore list all actions below should be ignored.

1) If file exist on both sides overwrite the one with older modification with the newer one.

2) If file only on 1 side. Checks db.
	- If file in db delete it.
	- If file not in db add it.
	
3) After sync files will be added to db if:
	- They exist on both side
	- If they exist on one side AND they would have beed deleted if delete was active.
	- If they exist on one side as a result of a failed copy (ie no read permission)
	they will NOT be added to db so that program doesn't try to delete it next time.
